                <h3>Processing Activities</h3>
                <h4>Collection of General Information When Visiting Our Website</h4><br>

                <h4>Type and Purpose of Processing</h4>
                <p>When you access our website, i.e. when you do not register or otherwise transmit information,
                    information of a general nature is automatically collected. This information (server log files)
                    includes, for example, the type of web browser, the operating system used, the domain name of your
                    Internet service provider, your IP address, and similar data.</p>

                <p>This information is processed in particular for the following purposes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ensuring a smooth connection setup of the website</li>
                    <li>Ensuring smooth use of our website</li>
                    <li>Ensuring and evaluating system security and stability, in particular for detecting misuse</li>
                    <li>For the technically correct presentation and optimization of the website</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>We do not use your data to draw conclusions about you personally. However, we reserve the right to
                    subsequently review the server log files if there are specific indications of unlawful use.</p>

                <h4>Legal Basis and Legitimate Interest</h4>
                <p>Processing is carried out pursuant to Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR based on our legitimate interest in
                    improving the stability and functionality of our website, as well as ensuring system security and
                    detecting misuse.</p>

                <h4>Recipients</h4>
                <p>Recipients of the data may be technical service providers acting as processors for the operation and
                    maintenance of our website.</p>

                <h4>Storage Period</h4>
                <p>Data is stored in server log files in a form that allows identification of the data subjects for a
                    maximum of 14 days, unless a security-relevant incident occurs (e.g. a DDoS attack).</p>
                <p>In the event of such an incident, server log files are stored until the security-relevant event has
                    been resolved and fully clarified.</p>

                <h4>Provision Required or Necessary</h4>
                <p>The provision of the aforementioned personal data is neither legally nor contractually required.
                    However, without the IP address, the operation and functionality of our website cannot be
                    guaranteed. In addition, certain services may be unavailable or restricted.</p>

                <h4>Objection</h4>
